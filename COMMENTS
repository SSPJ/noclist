# README

This repository contains an implmentation of the [Noclist](https://homework.adhoc.team/noclist) homework assignment.

([COMMENTS](COMMENTS) and [README.md](README.md) are the same file.)

## Installation

You'll want to have Python >= 3.8.x available. If you have `virtualenv` installed, you can do:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/SSPJ/noclist.git
$ cd noclist
$ virtualenv -p $(which python3.8) .
$ . bin/activate
```

To install the requirements, run:

```
(noclist) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the code

You'll need a server listening on 127.0.0.1:8888, as described in the homework assignment. (If this is not the correct host/port, you can edit the base url in [badsec/urls.py](badsec/urls.py).)

Ensure that [main.py](main.py) is executable, then run it:

```
(noclist) $ chmod u+x main.py
(noclist) $ ./main.py
```

## Running the tests

From the same directory as [main.py](main.py), run:

```
(noclist) $ pytest
```
